# Why Queue
Long waiting lines in clinics, grocery stores, and small businesses cause customer frustration and inefficiency. Traditional token-based systems lack real-time updates, leading to uncertainty and crowding.


This Physical Queue Management System allows users to join queues by scanning a QR code and receive real-time updates on their position. Businesses can efficiently serve customers through an interactive admin panel, reducing wait times and improving customer experience.

Unlike existing token systems or basic queue apps, our solution:

âœ… Uses WebSockets for real-time updates, ensuring instant position tracking.

âœ… QR-based queue joining, eliminating the need for physical tickets or registrations.

âœ… Automatic queue adjustment, dynamically updating user positions when someone is served.

âœ… Lightweight and cost-effective, making it accessible for small businesses without expensive hardware.
